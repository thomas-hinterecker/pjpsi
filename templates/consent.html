                        You have been invited to take part in a study of inferences and probabilities. The study is designed to investigate how people respond to certain inferences. It will be conducted by Thomas Hinterecker who is the principal investigator, at the Department of Psychology, Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Science, Justus Liebig University (JLU) of Giessen, Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to read inferences and assertions presented on a computer display and make judgments about them. Participation in this study will take about twenty minutes to complete, and you will receive Â£1.67 for your participation. We reserve the right to reject unsatisfactory submissions (e.g., too fast responses or merely guessing).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!--When you complete the study, a thorough verbal and written explanation of it will be
                        provided. -->In addition, by agreeing to participate, you understand you must be 18 years or older to participate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand how people make certain inferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity, and we are interested in group results rather than the responses of particular individuals. The anonymous data are kept in our laboratory and are only viewed by the investigators. These data files are kept on our computer indefinitely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking part in this study is voluntary. Not taking part or withdrawing after the study has begun will result in no loss of services from JLU to which you are otherwise entitled.
