            You will assess 13 problems in total.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each problem you first have to decide whether or not assertions follow of necessity from a premise, that is, given the truth of the premise must the assertion be true.
        </p>

        <p>
            Secondly, you have to estimate probabilities of certain assertions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Please read all of the assertions carefully! Take your time to think about your responses and do not merely guess.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            As soon as you are ready to start the experiment, press the "Begin experiment" Button.
