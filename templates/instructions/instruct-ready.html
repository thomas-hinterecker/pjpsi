            You will assess 11 problems in total.
        </p>
        <p>
            On each problem, you'll be presented with two assertions and you'll be asked to perform two tasks.
            In one task you have to determine whether both assertions could be true at the same time. In the other task you'll be provided with a given probability for the first assertion and you'll have to estimate probabilities of the second assertion. On every task the necessary instructions will be repeated briefly. Each problem will ask you to read the assertions before performing any task.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Please read all of the sentences carefully! Take your time to think about your responses and do not merely guess.

            As soon as you are ready to start the experiment, press the "Begin experiment" Button.
